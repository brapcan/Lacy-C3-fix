LaCyTools requires at least Python 3.8 and depends on NumPy, SciPy and matplotlib. NumPy and SciPy are used predominantly for data fitting and numerical operations on arrays. Matplotlib is used to draw all of the graphical elements that are used/created by LaCyToolsTools in both the GUI and the images (see the requirements.txt for the full list)
